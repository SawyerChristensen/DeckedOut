# gitignore contributors: remember to keep this file platform-agnostic
# gitignore test builds, just add two lines of defensive code to .git/config:
#       [core]
#               excludesfile = /Users/user/.gitignore_global
#
# Omit all .xcscmblueprint and .xcscheme files inside xcschememanagement.plist,
# as they are generated by Xcode and are not necessary to share.
#
# Additionally, filtering out UserInterfaceState.xcuserstate files is recommended
# to avoid unnecessary merge conflicts.

# It is recommended to not store the screenshots in the git repo. Instead, use fastlane to re-generate the
# screenshots whenever they are needed.
