Waiting for opponent screen issues:
    -check if "waiting for opponent" goes away after opponent move (need live devices...)

-meld checking & win screen

-better felt background, more green!

-localizations

-save current phase and where you drew in messagesViewController didResignActive?

-other card games?
-QOL changes?
*** Release 1.0? ***


*Possible* Bugs:
-figure out why simulator crashes upon exiting conversation view
-image resizes slightly from within send view to the conversation view


QOL changes:
-when the drag starts, the center of the card should move to the center of the touch location. it currently stays off center, usually to the right of the touch, (where you started the drag)
-animate opponent discard upon recieving move
-discard pile should look a little more random rather than a perfectly straight stack of cards?
-be able to rearrange your cards, (but not draw) during the opponents turn

-be able to drag from the discard pile in Gin as well as tap
-add sorting capability
-multiple deck aesthetics? could have a menu where you drag your preferred aesthetic to a pile, the pile card goes back to hand. the hand is all of the same card, aces? jacks? and you select from there which one you like most
-fan out the hand more on 7 card hands?

-do we really need a gin root view or is initializing the game view good enough?
-in present view do we need to dismiss any pop up windows?
