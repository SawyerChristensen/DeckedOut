-resolve card differences between cards being size 140 or 145

-make "start game" main menu text pulsate in scale?

-fan out the hand more on 7 card hands?

-see if discard animation actually works (proper animation to discard pile)

-discard pile should look a little more random rather than a perfectly straight stack of cards?

-Deck UI # should change based on how many cards there are left in the deck. when we get down to the final 5 cards, it should reflect that...

-better win screen? (maybe make it a joker card!) (happy or sad joker with its own colored shadow)

-better transcript win screen?

*----------* UPDATE 1.3 *----------* (The Aesthetic Update)


-error noise if the user attempts to draw again when resuming mid-turn?

-be able to rearrange your cards, (but not draw) during the opponents turn

-be able to drag from the discard pile in Gin as well as tap

-add auto-sorting capability

*----------* UPDATE 1.4 *----------* (The Functionality Update)



--Add other card games? Rename app if other games are added (add whole version number to each. pefect previous game before moving on)
    -Crazy 8s
    -Golf
    -Scopa
    -Yaniv
    -Cribage?

-update card look? maybe extra deck look option?
-multiple deck aesthetics? could have a menu where you drag your preferred aesthetic to a pile, the pile card goes back to hand. the hand is all of the same card, aces? jacks? and you select from there which one you like most


--Look into getting featured on the App Store!



*Possible* Bugs:
-lag between finishing the discard animation and backend finish turn operations. finish animation on main thread, everything else on background thread? (doesnt seem to be an issue most of the time) (only when simulating!)
-figure out why simulator crashes upon exiting conversation view
-simulator also doesnt recognize mid turn save, but devices do


QOL changes:
-make invite view wait on GIN! ?
-restart button from within the win view?
-refactor the deck reshuffling logic when it reaches 0 (animation?)
-resume button if we exit to main menu in game view?
-block against first turn wins, (1 in ~300,000, low priority)
-didCancelSending puts the card back on the deck? little easter egg. look into what didCancelSending actually does (low priority)
-do we really need a gin root view or is initializing the game view good enough? (doesnt really matter now)
-in present view do we need to dismiss any pop up windows? (doesnt really matter)


Optimizations:
-look into background threating of logic vs main threading of UI
-look into what variables in GameManager have to be @Published.
-remove self in game manager when it isnt needed for clarity
-is syncgameflow needed?
-does isFaceUp need to be a passed variable?
-init in player hand view should be in main body, not the extension
-figure out audio session failure print statement
-is isExplicitTap really needed?


Possible name for if other games are added:

CardVault
PocketDeck
