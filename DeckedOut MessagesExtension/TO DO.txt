Finish working main menu that enables users to select a game
    -fix initial entering of the subview bug. it teleports the first time, moves the second enter
    -figure out if we want the cards to reveal them or pull them up from the bottom (start with this?) reveal can be done later in an update
    -figure out a transition for entering the subview while in expanded mode
    -Hide win view if user has no wins?
    -Pulsating “tap card to play” reminder text in the middle of the screen if looked at for too long
    -add joker card under deck if user deals out all 5 in main menu
    -add hovering "handheld" effect to the top card? adding motion is always better
    -increase "start game" text movement in gin subview

Add those games (easier said that done)
    -Add starter transcript views for each game (to be updated later)

Add "how to" rules for each game with an icon on the main menu (on left?)

Add 0 opacity, uninteractable customization hangar icon on right, settigns icon below rules icon on left



--Add other card games? Rename app if other games are added (add whole version number to each. pefect previous game before moving on)
    -Crazy 8s
    -Golf
    -Hearts
    -Spades
    
    -Yaniv
    -Scopa?
    -Cribage?


-update card look? maybe extra deck look option?
-multiple deck aesthetics? could have a menu where you drag your preferred aesthetic to a pile, the pile card goes back to hand. the hand is all of the same card, aces? jacks? and you select from there which one you like most



--Look into getting featured on the App Store!




QOL changes / possible updates:
-Add rules section and a notice that Aces are not high cards in gin rummy!
-Deck UI # should change based on how many cards there are left in the deck. when we get down to the final 5 cards, it should reflect that
-discard pile should look a little more random rather than a perfectly straight stack of cards?
-better win screen? (maybe make it a joker card!) (happy or sad joker with its own colored shadow)
-better transcript win screen?
-make card sizing dynamic and grow card size if accessibility settings are turned on?
-be able to rearrange your cards, (but not draw) during the opponents turn
-be able to drag from the discard pile in Gin as well as tap?
-add auto-sorting capability?

-make invite view wait on "GIN!"?
-restart button from within the win view?
-refactor the deck reshuffling logic when it reaches 0 (animation?)
-resume button if we exit to main menu in game view?
-make discard animation better? (low priority), current is good if not preferrable due to immediate feedback
-block against first turn wins, (1 in ~300,000, low priority)
-didCancelSending puts the card back on the deck? little easter egg. look into what didCancelSending actually does (low priority)
-do we really need a gin root view or is initializing the game view good enough? (doesnt really matter now)
-in present view do we need to dismiss any pop up windows? (doesnt really matter)
-somehow clear a midturn save if the user resumed play on another device?


Optimizations:
-look into .constant binding thing in ginPlayerView?
-look into background threating of logic vs main threading of UI
-look into what variables in GameManager have to be @Published.
-remove self in game manager when it isnt needed for clarity
-is syncgameflow needed?
-does isFaceUp need to be a passed variable?
-init in player hand view should be in main body, not the extension
-figure out audio session failure print statement
