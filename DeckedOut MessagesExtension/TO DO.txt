-localizations
    -port to Hindi, Spanish, German, Italian, and French 1st
    -then to Portuguese (Brazilan), Japanese, Korean & Turkish?

-Bug fixes

-QOL changes?

*** Release 1.0? ***
(Specify Straight Gin Variant) (going gin is required)


Other card games? Check if we can rename afterwards


*Possible* Bugs:
-figure out why simulator crashes upon exiting conversation view
-image resizes slightly from within send view to the conversation view
-lag between finishing the discard animation and the backend send stuff. finish animation on main thread, everything else on background thread?
-building the app takes a LONG time, maybe just test version? grey screen for a long time


QOL changes:
-better felt background, more green?
-restart button from within the win view

-didCancelSending puts the card back on the deck? little easter egg

-when the drag starts, the center of the card should move to the center of the touch location. it currently stays off center, usually to the right of the touch, (where you started the drag)
-animate opponent discard upon recieving move
-discard pile should look a little more random rather than a perfectly straight stack of cards?
-be able to rearrange your cards, (but not draw) during the opponents turn

-be able to drag from the discard pile in Gin as well as tap
-add sorting capability
-multiple deck aesthetics? could have a menu where you drag your preferred aesthetic to a pile, the pile card goes back to hand. the hand is all of the same card, aces? jacks? and you select from there which one you like most
-fan out the hand more on 7 card hands?

-do we really need a gin root view or is initializing the game view good enough?
-in present view do we need to dismiss any pop up windows?
