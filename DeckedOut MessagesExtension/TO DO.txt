Planned for second update:
-use live layout when the game is over for transcript view
-update card look? maybe extra deck option?
-better win screen? (maybe make it a joker card!) (happy or sad joker with its own colored shadow)


--Look into getting featured on the App Store!

--Add other card games? Rename app if other games are added



*Possible* Bugs:
lag between finishing the discard animation and backend finish turn operations. finish animation on main thread, everything else on background thread? (doesnt seem to be an issue most of the time)
-figure out why simulator crashes upon exiting conversation view
-simulator also doesnt recognize mid turn save, but devices do


QOL changes:
-resume button if we exit to main menu in game view?
-refactor the deck reshuffling logic when it reaches 0 (animation?)
-resolve card differences between cards being size 140 or 145
-maybeee a menu that transitions more smoothly? current menu works perfectly fine
-look into shadow thing on the main menu on moms phone. some weird accessibility feature?
-add isExplicitTap funcaitonlity to loadstate, if the user selects a 2nd game session than the one already loaded. very unique edge case, but could still happen...
-Deck UI # should change based on how many cards there are left in the deck. when we get down to the final 5 cards, it should reflect that...
-proper animation to discard pile
-remove discard highlight if you are not in discard phase?
-look into *exact* draw offsets, rn they are close enough
-better felt background, more hd?
-discard pile should look a little more random rather than a perfectly straight stack of cards?
-restart button from within the win view
-didCancelSending puts the card back on the deck? little easter egg
-when the drag starts, the center of the card should move to the center of the touch location. it currently stays off center, usually to the right of the touch, (where you started the drag)
-be able to rearrange your cards, (but not draw) during the opponents turn
-be able to drag from the discard pile in Gin as well as tap
-add sorting capability
-multiple deck aesthetics? could have a menu where you drag your preferred aesthetic to a pile, the pile card goes back to hand. the hand is all of the same card, aces? jacks? and you select from there which one you like most
-fan out the hand more on 7 card hands?
-do we really need a gin root view or is initializing the game view good enough?
-in present view do we need to dismiss any pop up windows?
-error noise if the user attempts to draw again when resuming mid-turn?
-block against first turn wins, (1 in 300,000 something, low priority)


Optimizations:
-look into background threating of logic vs main threading of UI
-look into what variables in GameManager have to be @Published.
-remove self in game manager when it isnt needed for clarity
-is syncgameflow needed?
-does isFaceUp need to be a passed variable?
-init in player hand view should be in main body, not the extension
-figure out audio session failure print statement


Possible name for if other games are added:
DeckedOut
CardVault
PocketDeck
Card Games
